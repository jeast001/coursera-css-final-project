Steps
Create new code to get started. You must have three pages. Every page must have at least one image and at least one of those pages must have at least five (5) images. You can use the starter code as inspiration, but you should replace any images with your own image. (Here is a 
list of resources
 for finding diverse images.)

Validate your html using the 
w3validator
.

Use the position property and the focus pseudo-class to style your "Skip to Main Content" link.  It should only be visible when the link is in focus.

Style your navigation in an attractive fashion â€“ use at least three CSS properties.

Style all images using the box model. At a minimum use border, padding, and border-radius.

Apply the grid property to at least one parent element. Use at least two columns, but feel free to use more!

Apply the flex property to at least one parent element. The navigation bar is one place to use flex. You can also use it on images if you would like.

Update at least one element using the hover pseudo-class. Make sure that the hover property does something interesting. I encourage you to do an internet search on some common transitions and try those.

Implement the nth-child selector. In my example I used this on the flex page where I gave every other image a different border-radius. Don't forget, if you are styling an advanced selector it can be a little trickier to use the pseudo-classes. Work slowly and carefully.
